### Build and Start

The scaffolded project contains multiple modules. A fat jar server.jar will be generated in server/target directory after running the build command below.

```
./mvnw clean install
```

With the fatjar in the server/target directory, you can start the server with the following command.

```
java -jar server/target/server.jar
```

}else{
### Build and Start

The scaffolded project contains multiple modules. A fat jar server-fat-{version}.jar will be generated in server/build/libs directory after running the build command below.

```
./gradlew clean build
```

With the fatjar in the server/build/libs directory, you can start the server with the following command.

```
java -jar server/build/libs/server-fat-{version}.jar
```
}
}else{
@if(config.get("buildMaven").booleanValue()){
### Build and Start

The scaffolded project contains a single module. A fat jar server.jar will be generated in target directory after running the build command below.

```
./mvnw clean install -Prelease
```

With the fatjar in the server/target directory, you can start the server with the following command.

```
java -jar server/target/server.jar
```

To speed up the test, you can avoid the fat jar generation and start the server from Maven.

```
./mvnw clean install exec:exec
```

}else{
### Build and Start

The scaffolded project contains a single module. A fat jar server-fat-{version}.jar will be generated in build/libs directory after running the build command below.

```
./gradlew clean build
```

With the fatjar in the build/libs directory, you can start the server with the following command.

```
java -jar build/libs/server-fat-{version}.jar
```
}
}

### Test

By default, the OAuth2 JWT security verification is disabled, so you can use Curl or Postman to test your service right after the server is started. For example, the petstore API has the following endpoint.

```
curl -k https://localhost:8443/v1/pets
```

For your API, you need to change the path to match your specifications.
