# A light-codegen config file to generate the project used with light-proxy sidecar.
# It is the same as the original petstore config.json but with useSidecar set to true.
# This will make sure that the API doesn't wire in some of the middleware handlers as
# they are used in the light-proxy to address these cross-cutting concerns.
