Light platform contains several frameworks to build different style of APIs or microservices based
on the contract specifications. It encourages users to create service contract specification before
coding and it would be nice if we can scaffold a project based on the designed specification. Further,
it would be even nicer if we could utilize the specification during runtime to verify security and
validate input request based on the exact same specification. 

Before we built our own generator, we looked on the open source community and couldn't find anything
suitable to our need. So we built it over a weekend and it turned out very successful. If you want
to know more about it, please checkout the [light-codegen document](https://doc.networknt.com/tool/light-codegen/).

The generator is very easy to use and there are numeric ways to use it. Command line, Docker, Scripting
and Web UI. To get started, please follow the [getting-started](https://doc.networknt.com/getting-started/light-codegen/).

If you want know all the options with the light-codegen, you can follow the tutorials for each generator
at [light-codegen tutorial](https://doc.networknt.com/tutorial/generator/).

In addition, there are so many [other tutorials](https://doc.networknt.com/tutorial/) that are using 
light-codegen to scaffold projects and these can be found in the more wider tutorial section.
